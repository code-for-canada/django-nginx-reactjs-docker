#### New initiatives

You have been mandated to make a recommendation on the adoption of an “off-the- shelf” online request processing system. The proposed system, called Serv, provides features that would facilitate the management of client and partner requests for content review and documentation services. This includes enhanced categorization and tracking of pending requests, customizable forms applications, and various report generators. The Information Technology (IT) Team of the ODC recently facilitated a pilot test with Serv that included Danny McBride, who is a member of the Quality Assurance Team. Danny came back with positive feedback on his experience with the Serv system. Your team has been discussing the proposal to introduce this new technology in hopes of improving your services.
